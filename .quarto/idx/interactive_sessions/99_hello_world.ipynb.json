While it is often used for high-level applications and complex tasks, Python's object-oriented structure and clean syntax make it straightforward to learn. \n\nIn addition to Python scripts (`.py` files), many data scientists use Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for experimentation and visualization. \n\nNotebooks allow for rapid code evaluation and ease of use. For this reason, sessions have been designed in Jupyter Notebook format, though you are encouraged to explore Python scripts as well.\n\n\n\n\nThis first session will briefly introduce a few basic Python features.\n\n<p style=\"height:1pt\"> </p>\n\n<div class=\"boxhead1\">\n    Session Topics\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"boxtext1\">\n<ul class=\"a\">\n    <li> üìå Print statements </li>\n    <li> üìå User input </li>\n    <li> üìå Comments </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<hr style=\"border-top: 0.2px solid gray; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt\"></hr>\n\nWe will work through this notebook together.

Comments are usually used at the top of a program to provide a description of the program, name and information of the author, dependencies, etc., as well as throughout the script to explain lines of code. Commenting is a critical element of proper coding etiquette.\n\nThere are two types of comments: **in-line comments** and **block comments**. In-line comments are used to provide context at the end of a line of code, while block comments come before a \"block\" or chunk of code.\n\n<div class=\"python\">\n    üêç <b>Note.</b>\n    In Python, there are two ways of writing comments. For in-line comments and most short comments, the <span style=\"font-weight:bold\"> # </span> character is used. For large block comments, such as those at the beginning of a file or function, three quotations <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">  '''  </span> are used to enclose comments. Both single and double quotations are interpreted the same, as long as they are not used together.\n</div>\n\nThe following example is a function (a type of Python object we will cover later on) that uses both methods of commenting. As you can see, without the comments, it would be difficult to understand what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what the intermediate steps are to reach the end.\n\n```python    \ndef homo_affine_matrix(p, p_prime):\n    '''\n    Finds the unique homogeneous affine transformation that \n    transforms a set of 3 points from one coordinate system \n    to that of a second set of points in 3-D space\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    p : array\n        original set of points as a row vector: ((p1, p2, p3))\n    p_prime : array\n        Transformed points as a row vector: ((p1_prime, p2_prime, p3_prime))\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    array\n        4 x 3 affine transformation matrix.\n        \n    Source: Adapted by B.
