Launching VS Code and Installing the Python Extension:\n\nAfter installation, launch VS Code. We'll need the Python extension to work with Python in VS Code:\n\n- In the sidebar, click on the icon made of four little squares (Extensions).\n- Search for \"Python\" in the extensions search bar.\n- Click the install button for the official Microsoft Python extension.\n\n# 3. Configuring Python Interpreter and Conda:\n\nAssuming you've already installed Anaconda:\n\n**Windows/Mac/Linux:**\n- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the command palette.\n- Type `Python: Select Interpreter`.\n- From the dropdown, choose the conda environment corresponding to your course.\n\n# 4. Installing Jupyter Extension:\n\nSince you'll be working with Jupyter notebooks:\n\n- Go to Extensions again.\n- Search for \"Jupyter\".\n- Install the Jupyter extension provided by Microsoft.\n\n# 5. Integrating with GitHub:\n\n- Go to Extensions.\n- Search for \"GitHub Pull Requests and Issues\".\n- Install the extension.\n  \nOnce installed, you can clone repositories, manage pull requests, and even review code right within VS Code. You will need to sign in to your GitHub account when prompted.\n\n# 7. Optional Extensions for Data Scientists:\n\nHere are some other extensions that might be helpful (later in the course):\n\n- **Github Copilot:** Offers AI-assisted code suggestions.\n- **Python Docstring Generator:** Helps in automatically generating docstrings for Python functions.\n- **GitLens:** Enhances the Git capabilities of VS Code, allowing you to visualize code authorship.\n- **Linters and formatters:** These extensions help in linting and formatting your code. Some popular ones include Pylint, Flake8, Black, and autopep8.\n- **Code Spell Checker:** Helps in detecting spelling mistakes in your code.\n- **R Language Support:** If you're working with R, this extension provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and more.\n\nThere are tons of great extensions and they are easy to add and remove, so feel free to explore and experiment!\n\n\n\n# 4. Launching VSCode from a terminal:\n\nWith the environment activated, you can launch VSCode from the command line:\n\n```bash\ncode .\n```\nAlternatively, you can launch VSCode from the Windows Start Menu or MacOS Applications folder, or however you normally launch applications on your machine.\n\nOnce VSCode is open, you can open a new Python file. Ensure you select the \"Python (eds217_2023)\" kernel for your file. VSCode will prompt you to install the `ipykernel` package if it is not already installed. In addition, VSCode will remember the kernel you selected for each file, so you will only need to select the kernel once for each file.\n\n\n# Setting Up the `eds217_2023` Environment in VSCode\n\n## Prerequisites:\n\n1. Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.\n2. Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for VSCode from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.\n3. Follow the previous instructions to set up the `eds217_2023` environment on your machine.\n\n## Instructions:\n\n### 1. Open the `eds217_2023` Directory in VSCode:\n\nLaunch VSCode, then go to `File` > `Open Folder` (or `File` > `Open` on MacOS) and select the `eds217_2023` directory that you cloned from GitHub.\n\n### 2. Selecting the Python Interpreter:\n\nOnce the folder is open in VSCode:\n\n- Click on the Python version in the  corner of the VSCode window.\n- A list of available Python interpreters will appear at the top. Look for the one that corresponds to the `eds217_2023` environment. It should look something like this: `Python (eds217_2023)`.\n- Click on it to select it. This ensures that any Python file or Jupyter notebook you open in VSCode will use the `eds217_2023` environment.\n\n### 3. Verify the Jupyter Kernel:\n\nIf you're working with Jupyter notebooks in VSCode:\n\n- Open or create a new Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file).\n- In the top-right corner of the notebook editor, you'll see the kernel that the notebook is using. Ensure it says `Python (eds217_2023)`. If not, click on it and select `Python (eds217_2023)` from the dropdown list.\n\n### 4. Troubleshooting:\n\nIf you don't see the `eds217_2023` environment in the list of available interpreters or kernels:\n\n- Ensure you've activated the environment in your terminal and installed the Jupyter kernel as described in the previous instructions.\n\n- Restart VSCode.\n\nThere are a ton of great tutorials that can help you make the most of VSode.
