We won't have too many of these, but they will be used to introduce new concepts and provide context for the interactive sessions.\n\n### Interactive Sessions\n[Interactive sessions](interactive_sessions/interactive_sessions.ipynb) will be used to demonstrate the use of python syntax, libraries, and other tools essential to the environmental data science workflow. These sessions will generally be conducted in jupyter notebooks, and will be available for you to download and use as a reference. We will also use these sessions to work through example code and computations related to the major course topics.\n\n### Practice Sessions\n[Practice sessions](practice_sessions/practice_sessions.ipynb) will be used to provide opportunities to using the concepts, tools, and libraries presented during interactive sessions to solve more open-ended programming problems. While the goal is to develop independent confidence in python programming, we will work through these problems in paired/collaborative coding. Example solutions to these practice problems will always be available.\n\n### TryPy Sessions\n[TryPy sessions](trypy/trypy.ipynb) are designed to allow you to develop your own reproducible workflows based on core data science principles. We will often structure these sessions in a similar way to prior activities from `EDS221`. This will allow you to get a better understanding of the differences between `python` and `R` as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\n### Group Work \nYour [group project](group_project/python_data_science_show_and_tell.ipynb) is a \"Data Science Show-and-Tell\" that will extend the skills you develop during the first week of the course through the creation of collaborative presentations focused on datasets and libraries of your choosing. Working in teams, you will develop a short, reproducible tutorial on how to use a python data science library with examples using datasets relevant to environmental analysis. These tutorials will be presented to the class during the final week of the course and shared with the class via a github repository.\n\n\n## Course Outline\n\n### Tuesday, September 3 \n#### `Day[0]` - Ready, Set, Python!\n\nThe materials for our first day are designed to introduce the basics of working with Python and getting your local machines setup for the course.\n\n#### Morning Session\n\n[Entry Survey](https://forms.gle/AQmP5f6DjqTbKjPk9)\n\n[Intro to Python Data Science](lectures/00_intro_to_python.ipynb)\n\n[Interactive Session 0-1 - Ready, Set, Python!](interactive_sessions/0-1_ready_set_python.ipynb)\n\n#### Afternoon Session\n\nGetting Help\n\n[Interactive Session 0-2 - Hello, Python Data Science](interactive_sessions/0-2_hello_data_science.ipynb)\n\n\n\n### Wednesday, September 4 \n#### `Day[1]` - Do you speak Python?\n\nToday we will explore variables and learn the basic syntax of the python programming language.\n\n#### Morning Session\n[Interactive Session 1-1 - Variables & Operators](interactive_sessions/1-1_variables.ipynb)\n\n[Practice Session 1-1 - Variables & Operators](practice_sessions/practice_1-1_variables.ipynb)\n\n\n[Interactive Session 1-2 - Lists and Indexing](interactive_sessions/1-2_lists.ipynb)\n\n#### Afternoon Session \n\n[Practice Session 1-2 - Lists and Indexing](practice_sessions/practice_1-2_lists.ipynb)\n\n[TryPy 01 - St. Louis Lead Data](trypy/01_trypy_stl_blood/stl_blood_exercise.ipynb)\n\n\n### Thursday, September 5 \n#### `Day[2]` - Going with the flow\n\nToday we complete our quick tour of the core python language as we learn the fundamentals of controlling the flow of programs in python.
